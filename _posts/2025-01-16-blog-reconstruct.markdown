I decided to revert back to the default minima theme because I realize I spent too much time getting third party jekyll themes to work with Github Pages rather than writing.

Previous blog contents are also discarded as it was essentially half-baked slop content I wrote in an effort to make the site less empty-looking.

But I'm not leaving this blog. I will probably put gamedev stuff in here in the coming months. And I will update the site's theme as I go.
