# Greetings, fellow weary internet travellers!

Welcome to this niche internet corner of mine where I will share all of my *untamed musings* about my hobbies, my life, and its problems.

And while the premise of this site is to be a vessel for my unfiltered thoughts and babbles, I do hope I won't be oversharing
my life on the internet... where people can tell where you've been by observing a blade of grass that's been stuck on your shoes since this morning.
You know who you are, **ahem** *Rainbolt* **ahem**.

This is my first time writing a blog, in case you haven't noticed. One of the reason I started this blog was to improve my writing skill, because I could barely string together a valid
sentence in english. From here onward, My writings might get better, or worse. You'll be the judge.

If you want to know more about me, please don't. Though I will indulge to write a bit about myself. So here we go.

My name is Kevin. I live in one of the most densely populated island in Indonesia. I am currently working at an Apple Store
as a technician. Which is ironic considering how much I despise Apple Product and their practice. But I'm telling you, looking
for work in this economy without a degree is diffi-fucking-cult. So I had to accept the job I currently have and be grateful
for it. Might as well learn some social skills since the job also include handling customers. And so far it has been
enlightening, well... most of the time. Other times I wanna bash my head through the brick wall when handling Karens.

Now, I better end this introduction before I unconciously writing for the remaining 5 hours of my shift. See ya later cowboy!
