In my endless journey of seeking solace through melancholic tunes, I've stumbled upon a track from an album of an artist I've never heard before.

**Olivia, in a Separate Bed** is a song by the Brighton based singer-songwriter [Bess Atwell](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6Pim5E5Lm03COsjHj2aEiK){:target="_blank"}, released in 2021 as a track from the "Already, Always" album. The song was originally written by the writer and vocalist of Fleet Foxes, Robin Pecknold, back in 2012. Some regarded the song as the most gut wrenching heartbreak song written.

While it is carrying the clich√© of a post-breakup song, it somehow feels different compared to other songs with the same topic of heartbreak, it feels rather personal, it feels like the whole song wasn't meant to be heard by the public ears, and was intensified by the delisting of the original song by the creator from the online platform.

Bess' version of the track begins with a blanket of warm synth that extends into the whole song. The warmth of the synth works really well with the stark contrast of the cold-mixed vocals sang by Bess.

Not long after, we've arrived at the georgous chorus comprised of layers of warm saws, accompanied with strungs of acoustic guitar and buttery smooth vocals.

These type of soundscapes are my favourite by far, and indie bands are not afraid to use them. To mention a few; Weyes Blood's [Movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFtRq6t3jOo){:target="_blank"}, and Men I Trust used these soundscapes in several of their songs such as [Organon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RItrzOEkGbc){:target="_blank"}, and [Serenade Of Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgErI4qnYY0){:target="_blank"}.
