If you have played the game **Alien: Isolation** or if you've watched any of [J.J. Abrams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWNGMTcD_jY){:target="_blank"}' movie, then you are likely to have seen this effect applied whenever there's a bright object in a scene.

The effect is often used in games or movies with sci-fi genre because it gives the media that futuristic and cinematic look. It also enhances the realism in games because it simulates the imperfection of anamorphic lenses that is often used to shoot movies.
